Hi all, my name is Rebecca, I am 32. I currently reside in northern KY. I am a mother of a soon to be four-year-old daughter. About 6 months ago a lot of unexpected life changes had taken place, causing me to quit my job, total my car, and be left starting my life all over. leading me to here, I have always had a love and passion for tech, I remember being in middle school and using proxies to access otherwise blocked websites or being given a flip phone as a child and navigating my way around accessing features without the needed pay card at the time. I am fascinated by the many and seemingly endless possibilities with tech and Iâ€™m hoping to gain enough experience/knowledge and polishing to contribute to the field in some way.
